## Features
- Hardware Communication: Direct register-level control and configuration of the STM32F407 microcontroller.
- Driver Development: Examples demonstrating how to develop custom drivers.
- Modular Code Structure: Organized code to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Documentation: In-code comments and example usage scenarios for each module.
## Requirements
1. Hardware: STM32F4 Discovery kit or a compatible STM32F407-based development board.
2. Software:
- STM32CubeIDE (for project configuration)
- Git (for version control)
## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
``` git clone https://github.com/metevs09/driverdev_training.git ```
2. Open the project files in STM32CubeIDE and configure them for your specific development board.
3. Build the project and flash it to your device.
## Usage
The modules in this project are designed to utilize various hardware features of the STM32F4 microcontroller. Detailed usage examples and test scenarios are provided within the code comments and additional documentation.

For example, to test a specific driver module:

1. Navigate to the relevant files in the src/ folder.
2. Locate the usage example in main.c.
3. Compile and load the project onto your device to observe the behavior.
